The goal of tarflow.iquizoo is to provide workflow auto-generation for IQUIZOO data powered by [targets](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) package.

## Background

The preprocessing of IQUIZOO data used to be very harduous because the datasets were very disorganized. Newer version of database and games make things much better. Now there is a package called [preproc.iquizoo](https://github.com/psychelzh/preproc.iquizoo), containing all the required functions used in preprocessing. It facilitates analysis significantly. For now, with the advent of [targets](https://github.com/wlandau/targets), we can easily setup workflows to automate all the preprocessing! This is what this package does. Hopefully, it will make the analysis of IQUIZOO data a favorable thing.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("psychelzh/tarflow.iquizoo@develop")
```

Or you can install the stable version from [psychelzh's R-universe](https://psychelzh.r-universe.dev/) with:

``` r
install.packages("tarflow.iquizoo", repos = "https://psychelzh.r-universe.dev")
```

## Usage

This simplest way to use this package is to call `tarflow.iquizoo::use_targets()` to generate a {[targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/)} pipeline. After some basic parameters edit (follow the generated script), then you can run the pipeline by exectuing `targets::tar_make()` in R console. The pipeline will be executed in parallel by default.
