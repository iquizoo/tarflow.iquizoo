The goal of tarflow.iquizoo is to provide workflow auto-generation for IQUIZOO data powered by [targets](https://github.com/wlandau/targets) package.

## Background

The preprocessing of IQUIZOO data used to be very harduous because the datasets were very disorganized. Newer version of database and games make things much better. Now there is a package called [preproc.iquizoo](https://github.com/psychelzh/preproc.iquizoo), containing all the required functions used in preprocessing. It facilitates analysis significantly. For now, with the advent of [targets](https://github.com/wlandau/targets), we can easily setup workflows to automate all the preprocessing! This is what this package does. Hopefully, it will make the analysis of IQUIZOO data a favorable thing.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("psychelzh/tarflow.iquizoo")
```

## Usage

This package is essentially providing several rmarkdown templates for use. See [this article](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rmarkdown_templates.html) to understand how to open a new template.

Currently two templates are provided:

- `"fetch-iquizoo"` ("Fetch Iquizoo Data"): Fetch all the data as a whole, not appropriate for raw data preprocessing.
- `"fetch-iquizoo-branches"` ("Fetch Iquizoo Data Separately"): Fetch all the data separately by games, appropriate for raw data preprocessing.
