init(wizard = interactive(), schema = "scores", separate = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{wizard}{A logical value indicating whether to use interactive
operations. If \code{TRUE}, menus will be shown interactively.}

\item{schema}{The name of workflow to be used. Different name means different
targets pipelines.}

\item{separate}{Should the database downloading be separated into branches
based on games?}
}
\value{
\code{NULL} (invisibly). This function is called for its side-effect.

\details{
These steps are done in order:
\enumerate{
\item Prepare configuration file if not found. Configuration file is named as
"config.yml", which is basically used to set the \code{where-clause} for
database queries (\code{SQL}).
\item Prepare database query files (\code{SQL}). The major part of the whole work
is just to download data from database, so for now, up to four query files
are used. Note they are all \emph{"templates"} only, cannot be used directly.
\item Prepare "_targets.R". Package targets parses commands from this R
script, which plays a role as a workflow blueprint. In this step, users
will be asked to choose which "schema" to use if \code{wizard} is \code{TRUE},
typically when in interactive mode.
\item Add "_targets" to file .gitignore
if found.
\item Manually check configuration file "config.yml".
