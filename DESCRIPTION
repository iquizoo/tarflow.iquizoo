Authors@R:
    c(person(given = "Liang",
             family = "Zhang",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email = "psychelzh@outlook.com",

Description: For "iquizoo" data processing, there is already a package
    called "dataproc.iquizoo", but eventually the use of it is relied on a
    workflow. This package is used to build such workflows based on tools
    provided by "targets" package which mimicks the logic of "make",
    automating the building processes.
